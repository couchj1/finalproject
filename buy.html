            <h2>Where to buy?</h2>
                <p>Mid Century furniture can be found pretty much everywhere! But, depending on your budget, this can vary immensely.If you are a person who has a specific piece in mind and money is no problem, you are almost gauranteed to find it on sites like <a href="https://www.chairish.com/"> Chairish.com</a> or <a href="https://www.firstdibs.com/"> 1stDibs.com.</a> These sites have anything you could possibly want, but they price around 140% above market value.</p>
               
                <p>Your second, more reasonable, option is scouring the web, resale shops, and unknowing victims who don't realize the value of their pieces. Places like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist are where most pickers go to find their merchandise. If you are lucky and on time, you might just be able to scoop up a good deal before the pickers get to it. Good luck!</p>
                
                <p>The last option, the simplest way, is to find local small dealers who offer a variety of pieces for a reasonable market value. These sellers can be found on instagram, facebook, and local shops. This option is how you get the best of both worlds, a lower price and more accesibility.</p>
